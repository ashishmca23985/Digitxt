			<h3>ANNEXURE 2: STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES</h3>
		
		<p>The Data Exporter (the Client), as the data exporting organisation, has entered into a <a href="data-protection-addendum.html">Data Protection Addendum</a> (“DPA”) with the Data Importer (BulkSMS as the data processor), as the data importing organisation, each a “party”; together “the parties”.</p>
		<p>The parties HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.</p>	
		
		<h5>Background</h5>	
		<p>The data exporter has entered into a data processing addendum (“DPA”) with the data importer. Pursuant to the terms of the DPA, it is contemplated that services provided by the data importer will involve the transfer of personal data to data importer. Data importer is located in a country not ensuring an adequate level of data protection. To ensure compliance with Directive 95/46/EC and applicable data protection law, the controller agrees to the provision of such Services, including the processing of personal data incidental thereto, subject to the data importer’s execution of, and compliance with, the terms of these Clauses.</p>
			
				
		<h5>Clause 1 - Definitions</h5>	
		<p>For the purposes of the Clauses:</p>

			<li>to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;</li>
			<li>that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;</li>

			<li>If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.<br><br>
The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.</li>
			<li>If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</li>
		</ol>

		
		<h5>Clause 7 - Mediation and jurisdiction</h5>	
		<ol class="tc-p" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;padding:0 20px;">

In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.</li>
			<li>The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.</li>
